Write a report on what you have learned by describing the basic problems, the basic approaches to solving them, the main achievements to date, and the open problems. 

## paper's relations

最早：
An Axiomatic Proof Technique for Parallel Programs I

Owicki-Gries Reasoning for Weak Memory Models

## The project's feedback

```txt
Looks good. You might also want to look into Ch. 14 of the Winskel book for logics for reasoning about parallel programs. For placement of locks and reasoning about program equivalence, check out prior work on automatic placement of memory fences (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1998518 along with papers that cite that work).
```


I think I have to survey the different memory models(see the reference in paper)

static program order, *dynamic program order*?


我觉得这背后肯定得有一些axiomatic之类的东西，否则如何判断if啥的？


## The midterm report

Write a 1-2 pages midterm report. It should describe what you have done so far, whether you are keeping up with your proposed schedule, and how you plan to finish the project in the remaining time.
